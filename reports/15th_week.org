#+TITLE: Report for : Un intergiciel d’une base de données NewSQL qui considère la localité de l’application cliente -- 15th week --
#+AUTHOR: Marie Delavergne


* Analysis

- Thought I had it covered, but I figured out only the labels are changed, not the values
  + I was using ~df.index.set_levels(['3','25','45'], 2, inplace=True)~
#+CAPTION: Graph I had friday
#+NAME: fig:no_good

- Found out how to fix this, but in any case I didn't push what I've done friday
#+CAPTION: Seems to work now
#+NAME: fig:graph_sorted_nodes

- Also removed ~keystone_v3.~ from the name of the actions


* Readings

- Putting that somewhere: [[https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/partitioning.html#define-table-partitions-by-list][define table partitions by list for cockroachdb]]
  + the scenario is similar to what we want:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Consider a global online learning portal, RoachLearn, that has a database containing a table of students across the world. Suppose we have two datacenters: one in the United States and another in Australia. To reduce latency, we want to keep the students' data closer to their locations:

    We want to keep the data of the students located in the United States and Canada in the United States datacenter.
    We want to keep the data of students located in Australia and New Zealand in the Australian datacenter.
#+END_EXAMPLE
  + BUT it required an enterprise version
