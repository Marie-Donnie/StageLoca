* Working on the report

- Have to explain MariaDB Galera Cluster and CockroachDB


** MariaDB Galera Cluster

Looking at the [[http://galeracluster.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Minimizing-downtime-and-maximizing-elasticity-with-Galera-Cluster-for-MySQL.pdf][Galera white paper]] I realized:
- there was still a missing information about the synchronization in the replication, so I went right into the code: https://github.com/codership/galera/blob/3.x/galera/src/replicator_smm.cpp
  + looking to ~cert~ then ~report_last_commited~
- I didn't really checked the results for MGC on a grouped regions, even though:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 The implementation of synchronous replication in Galera Cluster for MySQL has however proven quite resilient to network conditions, and deploying a Galera Cluster across 2 or 3 continents is a popular choice. This is not only a good disaster recovery option, but a common strategy to minimize service response times towards the end user.
#+END_QUOTE
  + wanted to try a new deployment, but Jonathan has an experimentation to do
  + leave it that here anyway to remember to try it
