* Results

- This week end the experiments didn't work so I had to run it manually. I have at least the 45 nodes Cockroach experiments except for, with 150ms, these scenarios:
  + keystone/create-user-set-enabled-and-delete.yaml
  + keystone/create-and-list-users.yaml

* Meetings

- Have to fill in the slides for the presentation
  + we changed again the plan, measuring the impact of:
