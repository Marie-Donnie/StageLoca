#+TITLE: Report for : Un intergiciel d’une base de données NewSQL qui considère la localité de l’application cliente -- 2nd week --
#+AUTHOR: Marie Delavergne


* Monday 22 January [2018-01-22 lun.]

- Ronan gave me my assignment:
  - we focus on Keystone for now
    - try and deploy with MySQL on 1 node, then on 5 and then on 25
      - there is a variable in kolla-ansible asking what node to use for the database
	- I can fix it to a name defined in enos (controller = 1 node)
    - then try with cockroachDB

- Reminder

      #+BEGIN_SRC

      control
      #+END_SRC

- First, I jump on a frontend on G5K
- Then, I create a virtualenv to run enos
  #+BEGIN_SRC
  mkdir enos-deployment && cd enos-deployment
  virtualenv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  pip install -U pip
  pip install enos
  #+END_SRC
- Then, to configure
  #+BEGIN_SRC
  enos new > reservation.yaml
  emacs reservation.yaml
  #+END_SRC
- Realized I've should have done that on a node, so
#+BEGIN_SRC
oarsub -I -l 'walltime=2:00:00'
#+END_SRC
- And on the node
#+BEGIN_SRC
source venv/bin/activate
nano reservation.yaml
enos deploy
#+END_SRC
- Encountered an error - and so it begins -

- I can check in inventories used how the variables are defined
  - in this example, there is a node for database BUT as we saw
      #+BEGIN_SRC
      [mariadb:children]
      control
      #+END_SRC
  - this tells us that mariadb is used on the control node

- Trying to make bench, but got

- Using the doc for [[https://enos.readthedocs.io/en/2.3.0/provider/grid5000.html#deployment][2.3]] (thanks to Ronan), I can see that I require to add a file and change the setup on the frontend.

- Seems to run smoothly, something must be wrong somewhere.

- Of course, since I only took 2:00:00, I need to do it all over again after eating.

- Working on the files to enable working on 5 and 25 nodes at the same time
  - Copied inventory.sample, changed
      #+BEGIN_SRC
      [mariadb:children]
      database
      #+END_SRC
  - By doing so, I will use the number of nodes declared in the reservation.yaml file, which I also change to 5 and then 25.

- Launched bench (using ~nova-boot-list-cc.yml~)
  - on rally, you can run a [[https://github.com/openstack/rally/blob/master/tasks/openstack/scenario/keystone.yaml][task]]
    - usage: ~rally task validate task.yaml --task-args-file task_arguments.yaml~
  - but there are also the [[https://github.com/openstack/rally/tree/master/samples/tasks/scenarios/keystone][sample tasks]]
  - didn't work for nova scenario but I tested for one keystone scenario and it seemed it has ran smoothly, so I entirely changed the ~run.yml~ to run every scenarios
  - launched the full ~run.yml~
  - backup the reports from ~enos backup~
  - changed the files as stated above
  - relaunched deployment
    - got a problem with my deployment, it used the oargridjob already used, which hadn't enough nodes
    - don't work with ~oardel~ MUST use ~oargriddel <job_number>~ or ~enos destroy --hard~
    - finally got it working with ~oargriddel~

    - still stuck at =TASK [mariadb : Waiting for MariaDB service to be ready through VIP]=
    - searched a bit for this error on the net. Seems there was a bug with ports 2 years back, but it's supposed to be fixed and I can't find much about this error if filtering only this year.


- While waiting for the tests to run, I'm trying to do minor changes to my enos
  - Corrected a typo
  - Create different reservation.yaml.sample for different providers (in my case, g5k)
    - Wondering about the usefulness of this...
    - usage: ~enos new grid5000 > reservation.yaml~
    - would require to make a new sample and modify ~enos.py~ each time a provider is added


- Since 5 nodes for the db doesn't work at that time, I will try to make cockroach work with enos
  - I revert my changes to ~reservation.yaml~

- Ronan came to help me

  - look for tuto galera/mariadb docker
  - cf notes

** Beginning work on enoslib

- [[https://github.com/BeyondTheClouds/enoslib][EnOSlib]]
- [[https://enoslib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/][EnOSlib doc]]

- Enoslib allows to get resources from a testbed and deploy an experiment workflow on those resources
  - does not only deploy OS
- So I will have to:
  1. get the resources
  2. deploy MariaDB+Galera / CockroachDB
     - will have to be containerized
  3. deploy OS with devstack


- First of all, I clone enoslib.
- Doing the tutorial for grid5k \to ok
- Trying to understand how [[https://github.com/msimonin/ombt-orchestrator][ombt orchestrator]] is working
  - Following the readme, add to adapt it a bit, because there was no
    #+BEGIN_SRC

  - Tried to see the usage

  - it began its work, deploying on 4 parasilo nodes

    #+BEGIN_SRC
    ./cli.py test_case_1 --nbr_clients 10 --nbr_servers 2
    #+END_SRC
  - do the backup, it is just like enos

    ./cli.py backup
    #+END_SRC
  - then destroy
    #+BEGIN_SRC
    ./cli.py destroy
    #+END_SRC

- Since the test was done with ~test_case_1.ipynb~, I feel like I have to check how one can use Jupyter, as Ronan told me that was Matthieu uses for ombt-orchestration

** Formalism on distributed databases

- Adrien had a question about why we don't just forward the request as seen on

#+CAPTION: Dynamic table union
#+NAME: fig:forma_request
[[../images/Forma_request.png]]

- A is the federation  of databases.
- B, C and D are concrete databases who share, as an example, all Openstack tables
- A receives a request requiring to use B, C and D
- a lock would be used on each rows required

- what we want is to be able to make requests on a federation (union) of databases that share the same schema

- For that, we will probably need
  + projection: unary operation defining a subset of a relation
    - noted \Pi_{a_1,...,a_n}(R)
    - with:
      + a_{1},...,a_{n}: set of attribute names
      + R: the relation from which the subset will be taken
    - result:
      + \Pi_{a_1, ...,a_n}(R) = {t[a_{1}..,a_n}] : t \in R}
      + with t[a_{1},...,a_{n}] = { (a', v) | (a', v) \in t, a' \in a_{1},..,a_{n}
    - example:
      + \Pi_{age,weight}(Person): age and weight are the attribute names, Person is the relation
    - in SQL: ~SELECT~
  + selection: unary operation defining a subset of a relation too
    - noted \sigma_{a \theta b}(R) or \sigma_{a \theta v}(R)
    - with:
      + a and b: attribute names
      + \theta: binary operation in the set { \lt, \leq, =, \neq, \geq, \gt }
      + v: constant value
      + R: relation from which the subset will be taken
     - result:
      + \sigma_{a \theta b}(R) = { t : t \in R, t(a) \theta t(b)}
      + \sigma_{a \theta v}(R) = { t : t \in R, t(a) \theta v}
    - example:
      + \sigma_{age=34}(Person): age is the attribute name, 34 a constant value and Person the relation
      + \sigma_{age=weight}(Person): age and weight are attributes names and Person the relation
    - in SQL: ~WHERE~
  + (set) union
    - noted R_{1} \cup R_{2} = {x: x \in R_{1} \vee x \in R_{2}}
  + (set) difference
    - noted R_{1} \ R_{2} = {x: x \in R_{1} \wedge x \notin R_{2}}
  + intersection
    - noted R_{1} \cap R_{2} = {x: x \in R_{1} \wedge x \in R_{2}}
  + Cartesian product
    - noted R_{1} \times R_{2} = {(x,y): x \in R_{1} \wedge y \in R_{2}}
    - in SQL: ~CROSS JOIN~
  + natural join
    - noted R \bowtie S = { r \cup s | r \in R \wedge s \in S \wedge P(r \cup s)}
    - with P a predicate that is true for a function t.
    - note: if R and S have no common attribute, it's the cartesian product
    - in SQL: ~NATURAL JOIN~

- Now we will have to use them on our operations, i.e. (from Ronan):
  - a. Create Role/Project
  - b. Create/Register a service end-point
  - c. Create a VMI
  - d. Create a Network for the VM
  - e. Create a VM on the ''orginal'' site
  - f. Create/use a remote-attached volume (cinder like capability)

- To do so, I'm reading chapter 7 from /Principles of Distributed Database Systems/
  + they present the transformations (equivalence) rules described by Ullman
    1. commutativity of binary operators ( A R B \Leftrightarrow B R A)
       - cartesian product
       - join
       - union
    2. associativity of binary operators ( A R(B R C) \Leftrightarrow (A R B)R C
       - cartesian product
       - join
    3. idempotence of unary operators ( R(R(A)) \Leftrightarrow R(A) )
       - projection: \Pi_{A'}(\Pi_{A''}(R) \Leftrightarrow \Pi_{A'}(R)
       - selection: \sigma_{p_1(A_1)}(\sigma_{p_2(A_2)}(R)) = \sigma_{p_1(A_1) \wedge p_2(A_2)}(R)
    4. Commuting selection with projection
       - \Pi_{A_1,...,A_n}(\sigma_{p(A_p)}(R)) \Leftrightarrow \Pi_{A_1,...,A_n}(\sigma_{p(A_p)}(\Pi_{A_1,...,A_n,A_p}(R)))
    5. Commuting selection with binary operators
    6. Commuting projection with binary operators
  + the techniques for decomposing and restructuring queries apply to both centralized and distributed DBMS
    - do not take into account the distribution of data
    - this is the role of the localization layer
      #+CAPTION: Normalized relations used in the book
      #+NAME: fig:normalized_relations
      [[../images/PDDS_normalized_relations.png]]
    - when fragmenting a relation *horizontally*, the localization program needs the union of the fragments
      + selection: when fragments are selected by contradicting predicates (i.e. none of the tuples from the tables can satisfy the predicate of other tables), a selection can be reduced using these predicates
      #+CAPTION: Reduction for Horizontal Fragmentation (with Selection)
      #+NAME: fig:reducing_selection
      [[../images/PDDS_reduc_selec.png]]
      + join: when fragments from different relations have an equivalent predicate, you use the union of joins from the corresponding fragments rather than the join of unions if the partial joins are few in numbers
	- localized query better when there are a large number of partial joins in the reduced query
	- and so reduced query is better when the number of partial joins is small
      #+CAPTION: Reduction for Horizontal Fragmentation (with Join)
      #+NAME: fig:reducing_join
      [[../images/PDDS_reduc_join.png]]

** Readings

- Reminder for fragmentation (partitioning):
  + horizontal partitioning, also called sharding, consists in separating different rows into different tables, based on a value of an attribute
  + vertical partitioning separates the tables on their columns
  + hybrid partitioning uses both kind of fragmentations, producing a tree-sructured partitioning (horizontal then vertical or vice versa)
- when fragmenting a relation *vertically*, the localization program needs the join of the fragments
  + projection: when doing a projection on attributes, you can reduce the query to the fragments that actually have that column
    #+CAPTION: Reduction for Vertical Fragmentation
    #+NAME: fig:reducing_projection
    [[../images/PDDS_reduc_projec.png]]
  + for distributed fragmentation, you have to reduce the query by removing the useless branches
    #+CAPTION: Reduction for Derived Fragmentation
    #+NAME: fig:reducing_derived
    [[../images/PDDS_reduc_distributed_frag.png]]
    - the query was
      #+BEGIN_SRC
SELECT *
FROM EMP, ASG
WHERE ASG.ENO = EMP.ENO
AND TITLE = "Mech. Eng."
      #+END_SRC
    - the corresponding localized query is shown in figure (a), with
      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
ASG_{1} = ASG (leftjoin)ENO EMP_{1}
ASG_{2} = ASG (leftjoin)ENO EMP_{2}
EMP_{1} = \sigma_{TITLE=”Programmer”}(EMP)
EMP_{2} = σ_{TITLE \neq ”Programmer”}(EMP)
      #+END_QUOTE
    - (b) Since the selection for Title="Mech. Eng." conflicts with EMP_{1} (Title="Programmer"), we can remove EMP_{1}
    - (c) Using (R_{1} \cup R_{2} ) |X| S = (R_{1} |X| S) \cup (R_{2} |X| S), the unions are pushed up
    - (d) On the left branch, there can be no join on Title="Programmer" and Title\neq"Programmer", so the branch is removed
  + for hybrid, you can combine the rules used in horizontal, vertical and derived horizontal fragmentation:
    1. Remove empty relations generated by contradicting selections on horizontal fragments
    2. Remove useless relations generated by projections on vertical fragments
    3. Distribute joins over unions in order to isolate and remove useless joins

- Queries produced by decomposition and data localization layers
  + produce a query where worse executions are avoided
  + can be optimized further using quantitative information on the fragments

- Looking the chapter 6, which seems interesting because query processing is interesting in our case (cf notes)

- Two principles comes from this table:
  + since complexity is relative to relation cardinalities, selections should be performed first as they reduce the cardinality
  + operators should be ordered by increasing complexity to avoid or delay costly operators like Cartesian Product
- Import characteristics of query processors (the last four are particular to distributed query processors in tightly integrated distributed DBMS:
  + language
    - query processing must perform efficient mapping between the input and the output languages
  + types of optimization
    - important but costly, especially when the number of relations or fragments involved increases
    - use of heuristics
      + minimize the size of intermediate relations; it is done by performing unary operators first and then ordering the binary ones by the increasing size of their intermediate
      + in DS: replace join operators by combinations of semijoins to minimize data communication
  + optimization timing
    - optimizations can be done statically before executing the query, or dynamically as the query is executed
  + statistics
    - need periodic updating
    - help improving a query optimization
  + decision sites
    - decision process can be centralized (requires knowledge of the entire DDb), distributed (requires only local information) or hybrid (one site make the major decisions and others make local decisions)
  + exploitation of the network topology
    - LAN: optimization of the processing of join operators
    - other algorithms specialize on star networks or sattelite networks
    - for a client-server environment, the client can be exploited to perform database operators
  + eploitation of replicated fragments
    - some algorithms exploits the replicated fragments at run time to minimize the cost of communication
  + use of semijoins
    - reduce the size of operand relation

- Static and semicentralized query processor
#+CAPTION: Generic Layering Scheme for Distributed Query Processing
#+NAME: fig:layer_qp
[[../images/PDDS_layers_qp.png]]
- Query decomposition:
  1. Normalization of the query by rewrittings. It usually involves the manipulation of query quantifiers and qualification by applying logical operator priority
  2. Semantic analysis of the query to seek and reject incorrect queries
  3. Simplification of the query (elimination of redundancy)
  4. Restructuration of the query into an algebraic query
