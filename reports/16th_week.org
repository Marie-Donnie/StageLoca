#+TITLE: Report for : Un intergiciel d’une base de données NewSQL qui considère la localité de l’application cliente -- 16th week --
#+AUTHOR: Marie Delavergne

* Results

- None of my experiments from this week-end worked :-/

- Doing the 3 nodes mariadb experiments, these are quick

- Watching the tendencies from these new tests on the same cluster, it seems really more consistent than before

#+CAPTION: Tendencies without all results
#+NAME: fig:tendencies
[[../images/tendance.png]]

- Checking the behaviour of the regions for cockroach
  + ok for ping, though I forgot to add the constraint network, it might be why it's so long

- Got a problem with regions on paravance ; used ecotype when I could (also got cadvisor bug)

- Still got the memory problem on the frontend, so I try to use the control as the deployment machine
  + Wanted to try and remove the full deploy from the loop in the experiments to avoid the kadeploy that requires a password to be executed when not on a frontend

- To get some nodes using reservation for the day: ~funk -w 5:30:00 -r ecotype:16~.
  + Since it gave me a message stating that my reservation could only begin after 10:43 ~funk -w 5:30:00 -r ecotype:16 -s 10:44:30~ worked like a charm

- Checking regions for Cockroachdb deployed with 3 groups of 5 nodes, separated by 50 ms of latency
  + realized I was still using "test" for region
    - finally fixed it with the ~'group_names': [u'chrony', u'database2', u'openstack', u'rally', u'sysbench']~ variable ( [[https://github.com/Marie-Donnie/juice/commit/4a916598e1730717479f3d8add14d427cec6ac08][here]] )
    - nope, still not working.
    - finally fixed it, the loop considered the variable as a string

    - still got some problems with rally:

- Searched for "geo-partitioning database" articles, but I'm not sure if any of the results is usable.

- Resumed the readings
