#+TITLE: Report for : Un intergiciel d’une base de données NewSQL qui considère la localité de l’application cliente -- 16th week --
#+AUTHOR: Marie Delavergne

* Results

- None of my experiments from this week-end worked :-/

- Doing the 3 nodes mariadb experiments, these are quick

- Watching the tendencies from these new tests on the same cluster, it seems really more consistent than before

#+CAPTION: Tendencies without all results
#+NAME: fig:tendencies
[[../images/tendance.png]]

- Checking the behaviour of the regions for cockroach
  + ok for ping, though I forgot to add the constraint network, it might be why it's so long

- Got a problem with regions on paravance ; used ecotype when I could (also got cadvisor bug)

- Still got the memory problem on the frontend, so I try to use the control as the deployment machine
  + Wanted to try and remove the full deploy from the loop in the experiments to avoid the kadeploy that requires a password to be executed when not on a frontend

* Readings

- Searched for "geo-partitioning database" articles, but I'm not sure if any of the results is usable.
