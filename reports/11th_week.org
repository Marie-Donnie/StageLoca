- Matthieu answered once more to my pull request [[https://github.com/BeyondTheClouds/enoslib/pull/18#issuecomment-376072658][here]] so I'm going to work on that first
  + using PyCharm to make the tests
  + took some time to figure out I needed a venv and how to use it in PyCharm ( [[http://exponential.io/blog/2015/02/10/configure-pycharm-to-use-virtualenv/][help here]] )
  + finally got a good way to add constraints like ~src==dst~ because they were removed from the ~generate_default_grp_constraints~ with ~grp1 != grp2~. I couldn't change this since this would mean I would have a lot more constraints everywhere (doing the product from src and dst). So I checked if there was a constraint where the src and dst were equals and added them here so the default treatment would take care of them

- Tried to help Jonathan with his tests on tidb using juice, it seems that there is a bug when using a comma


* Thursday 27 March [2018-03-27 mar.]

- Finished my Pull Request (I didn't see yesterday that Matthieu wanted me to check if there was one and only one dict with ~src == dst == grp1~ )
  + Discovered by the way that I can test this withou using ~src == dst and src == dst~
  + Also, sum([True, False, True]) returns the number of True.

- Working on federation
  + Corrected some errors. Actually, while deploying, there are a lot of errors from little things I didn't see.
  + Deploy worked with MariaDB not used with Galera
    - Reminder : to connect to MariaDB on node grisou-x: ~ docker run --rm -it mariadb mysql -h 172.16.72.x -u root -p ~
    - I can create databases and they are not replicated to other nodes
  + Openstack ok on each separate nodes

#+END_EXAMPLE
  + Using [[https://docs.openstack.org/keystone/ocata/apache-httpd.html][this tuto]] to have a keystone running in httpd
    - ~cp /opt/stack/keystone/httpd/uwsgi-keystone.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/~
    - ~ln -s /etc/apache2/sites-available/uwsgi-keystone.conf /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/~
    - ~systemctl restart apache2~
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
root@grisou-25:~# cp /opt/stack/keystone/httpd/keystone-uwsgi-admin.ini /etc/keystone/
root@grisou-25:~# ls /etc/keystone/
credential-keys  keystone.conf	     keystone-uwsgi-admin.ini
fernet-keys	 keystone-paste.ini  keystone-uwsgi-public.ini
root@grisou-25:~# cp /opt/stack/keystone/httpd/keystone-uwsgi-public.ini /etc/keystone/
#+END_EXAMPLE
  + Setting Shibboleth up (from [[https://docs.openstack.org/keystone/pike/advanced-topics/federation/shibboleth.html][here]])
    - ~apt install libapache2-mod-shib2~
    - ~vim /etc/apache2/sites-available/uwsgi-keystone.conf~ + ~WSGIScriptAliasMatch ^(/v3/OS-FEDERATION/identity_providers/.*?/protocols/.*?/auth)$ /usr/local/bin/keystone-wsgi-public/$1~
    - got an 'Invalid command 'WSGIScriptAliasMatch'' error, solved it with ~apt install libapache2-mod-wsgi~ (cf [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9947497/i-am-getting-invalid-command-wsgiscriptalias-error-while-starting-apache][stack overflow]])
    - ~shib-keygen -y 2018~
  + ok, a lot happened without me doing some feedback
    - main thing I finally understand that I can use keystone either as a SP or an IdP, not both for the same keystone
    - that means I have to decide if I'm using as a SP on every nodes with a common IdP, vice-versa, or using a keystone as IdP and others as SP or vice-versa
    - still feels like I don't know what I'm talking about

- Getting some documentation about Keystone Federation:
  + [[https://developer.rackspace.com/blog/keystone-to-keystone-federation-with-openstack-ansible/][with openstack ansible]] a bit old and using "openstack-ansible"
  + [[https://docs.openstack.org/keystone/pike/admin/federated-identity.html][openstack doc]] seems well documented ( also [[https://docs.openstack.org/keystone/pike/advanced-topics/federation/federated_identity.html][this link]]  and [[http://specs.openstack.org/openstack/keystone-specs/specs/juno/keystone-to-keystone-federation.html][some documentation about the federations, how they work]] )
  + [[https://platform9.com/blog/openstack-keystone-federation/][how to setup keystone federation]] from platform9
  + [[http://blog.rodrigods.com/it-is-time-to-play-with-keystone-to-keystone-federation-in-kilo/][how to play with keystone federation]] in kilo

- Just realized I didn't talk about my experiments last night.
  + First, I thought I would be able to use deploy one hour before the reservation but all I got was
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  File "/home/madelavergne/juice/venv/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/execo_g5k/oargrid.py", line 323, in wait_oargrid_job_start
    sleep(until = get_oargrid_job_info(oargrid_job_id, frontend_connection_params, timeout)['start_date'])
KeyError: 'start_date'
#+END_EXAMPLE
  + So I tried after the beginning of the reservation (19:00:01) with the same results.
  + I resigned and deleted my reservation before making another, but from my conf, I only took 9 hours
  + Don't know why, but even if I launched my experiments in a tmux, each time I left I got a broken pipe or something like that.
  + I decided to let my computer run all night...

[[../images/results-from-monday.png]]
  + Good news is it made me find out why Jonathan's backup didn't work either, there was a missing
#+BEGIN_SRC python
# Set monitoring to True by default
"enable_monitoring": env['config'].get('enable_monitoring', True)
#+END_SRC

* Wednesday 28 March [2018-03-28 mer.]

- Ronan told me to focus on analyzing the results
  + got the 'ipv4' undefined variable again, so I'm trying to see where this comes from.
    - in =no_push/hostvars-2=, I can see that indeed, there are no ipv4 adress on =ansible_eth1= (barely an ipv6 on themselves)
  + worked on analysis but I'm totally rusty for os stuff on python

- Adrien asked me to make a clean test plan
