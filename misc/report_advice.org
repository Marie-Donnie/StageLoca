(For thesis introduction)

Keep it short, *7 to 10 pages*

- Context of the study ::
 + Provide a brief history of the issues to date.
 + Situate your particular topic withing the broad area of research.
 + Note that the field is changing, and more research is required on
   your topic.
- Statement of the Problem ::
 + Or, motivation for the study!
 + Identify a key point of concern (for example, increasing use or
   prominence, lack of research to date, response to an agenda, a new
   discovery, or perhaps one not yet applied to this context).
 + Refer to the literature only to the extent needed to demponstrate
   why your project is worth doing. Reserve your full review of
   existing theory or practice for later chapter.
 + Be sure that the motivation, or problem, suggests a need for
   further investigation.
- Aim and Scope ::
 + Be sure that your *aim* responds logically to the problem
   statement.
 + Stick rigorously to a single aim. Do not include elements in it
   that describe how you intend to achieve this aim; reserve these
   for a later chapter.
 + Present clearly the limit. What your thesis doesn't do.
 + When you have written the conclusion to your whole study, check
   that they respond to this aim. If they don't, change the aim or
   rethink your conclusion.
 + If you change the aim, revise the motivation for studying it.
 + Be sure to establish the scope of your study by identifying
   limitations of factors such as time, location, resources, or the
   extablished of particular fields or theories.
- Significance of the Study ::
 + Explain how your thesis contributes to the field.
 + There are four main areas of contribution: theory development,
   tangible solution, innovative methods, and policy extension. One
   of these contributions must ve identified as the basis of your
   primary contribution to the field.
 + In contrast to reports for industry, theory development is an
   expected and required contribution; for PhDs in particular, it
   must be "original".
- Overview of the Study ::
 + Or, Structure of the Thesis!
 + Sketch out how the thesis is structured. Don't confine yourself to
   a list of the chapter, but show how they are linked and that one
   section logiclally leads to another.
 + Check wheter the reader can see from this sketch how the aim will
   be achieved.

Revising your introduction, aligning your conclusion:
- To avoid making promises to the examinar that you can't keep or that
 you do not later address, regularly review your introduction chapter
 and revise it accordingly.
- Consider starting your conclusioooon chapter on the same day that
 you begin your introduction, and, each time you work on one, work on
 the other, thus keeping them in aligment.
